# Yelp-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-Using-Transformers
This project performs sentiment analysis on Yelp reviews using a pre-trained BERT-based transformer model. We scrape reviews from a specific Yelp business page, analyze them, and assign sentiment scores ranging from 1 (negative) to 5 (positive). The notebook includes code for collecting, processing, and scoring reviews, along with a brief explanation of the methods used.
